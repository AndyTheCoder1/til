title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):


*I was given a refresher on many of the concepts from App Dev I*

*I learned concepts about asserts and about testing in general*

*I was reminded of the value of using IRB to make the invisible visible*
